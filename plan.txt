-Train convolutional neural network(s) for position and/or move analysis in hex (try 13x13 first)
-Train by Deep TD learning of some kind
-Use something like simple resistance heuristic as a mentor
-Generate around 10,000 games worth of plausible positions using stochastic version of wolve
-Use batch normalization
-Use some elements of deep symmetry networks (preserve reflection symmetry)
-board encoded using opponent cells, player cells and 2 edge connection channels for player cells 
-at least one layer of out of bounds cells will be included and colored as the apporpriate edge with edge connection set appropriately
-do not bother to backpropogate error for filled (unplayable) cells since these can be trivially eliminated anyway and learning them is thus irrelevant
